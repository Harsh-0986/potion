      Hi there,
    </h2>
    <p>
      this is a basic <em>basic</em> example of <strong>tiptap</strong>. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you‚Äôd probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        That‚Äôs a bullet list with one ‚Ä¶
      </li>
      <li>
        ‚Ä¶ or two list items.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Isn‚Äôt that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Let‚Äôs try a code block:
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body {
  display: none;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      I know, I know, this is impressive. It‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don‚Äôt forget to check the other examples too.
    </p>

      Wow, that‚Äôs amazing. Good work, boy! üëè
